# PhoneBook-v.2.0
VERSION 2.0 IS OUT! In this new version of PhoneBook, the user will have to input their contacts (like Version 1.0), BUT this time your contacts will be stored in either a Microsoft EXCEL file or a Apple NUMBERS file which you can use later. NOTE: THE DATA WILL NOT BE LOST LIKE LAST TIME. There are a some aspects of the code I can improve; I will include those in the next update of PhoneBook :)
